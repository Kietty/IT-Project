<p><strong>Huynh Phan Anh</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">My name is Anh, my id is s3891735
I'm grateful to say that I'm very enthusiatic about technology, and this is a great chance for me here at Rmit to get a rigid 
cover about how it works and how can I practically get involve in relevant issue and resolving problem using technical technique.
Moreover, this is my opportunity here at RMIT to settle everything down and construct a certain level of knowledge of what I love. 
In addition, it's going to be useful as I have a few of hand-on experienced in such as python, JS, C++, HTML,... and they are not 
going to be waste here as I'm going to need it as my team does. That's it for now, hopefully in the long run ahead I would love to seek
out great chance as in cooperation and study.

<p><strong>Mai Tran Duy Anh</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Let me begin by introducing myself, Mai Tran Duy Anh is my complete name, and when I meet new people or travel overseas, I introduce myself as Dylan. I was born and raised in Vietnam. After finishing a semester here at RMIT, I found out that communicating is crucial, so you may contact me via my educational email address is s3926247@rmit.edu.vn if you have any questions concerning my studies. Currently, I am pursuing a bachelor's degree in Information Technology from RMIT University in order to land a decent career related to my field of interest. In addition to studying and working to accomplish my dream, I also enjoy games, particularly online games where there is a community of people who share my interests. As a result, my ambition is to build an online game that draws a large number of players, and in order to accomplish so, I've begun studying MySQL and Unity even knowing that my expertise is disorganized and limited, like a grain of sand among a desert of computer languages.</p>

<p><strong>Sunjin Lee</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">My name is Lee Sunjin and my student number is S3911760, I am a first-semester freshman. To be honest, I haven't discovered a major that fascinates me, but after much search and contemplation, I decided on IT as a major at RMIT University. This is not to say that I chose this major only on the basis of its potential; rather, I discovered that the characteristics of a developer or programmer fit my personality.</p>

<p><strong>Nguyen Minh Trong Nhan</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">My name is Nhan and S3924462 is my student number, I'm currently a first-year student in RMIT university. I chose IT as my main course because during high school, one of my teacher recommended IT to me after doing a personality test. However, the test wasn't the only reason i chose IT as my major but I also did my own research on various majors and topics and picking my final verdict on IT. As of why I chose RMIT as my university and not other schools, simply because i already have a brother who studied here in RMIT and is currently an allumni.
  Other than video games and some Youtube videos. It to me is a completely new world, and I want learn this experience as much as possible before i graduate.</p>
